Description: A series of functions to help R users get the most out of Databricks.  Quickly convert your R scripts
    to a job, check the status of running jobs, move files between DBFS and your local system, and more.  Since the package
    uses the Databricks REST API 2.0, you'll need an authentication token for the functions to work.  You can find one under
    'User Settings' in the Databricks web interface.
